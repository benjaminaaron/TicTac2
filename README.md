TicTacToe SmartBots
=================

This is forked from our original TicTac2 game for android (https://github.com/bbuecherl/TicTac2) but stripped-down to only the two smart bots @bbuecherl and I were implementing (insights into their development here: https://github.com/bbuecherl/TicTac2/issues/9) with the purpose of revisiting the logic of the respective decision making process in order to build on it for other projects, conceptually or literally :)

Out of the box `Main.java` pits the two smart bots against each other with two marks per turn on a 5x5 field and winning length 5. The syntax for human players or random bots is in the comments if you want to play around. No visual output, it all happens in the console.
